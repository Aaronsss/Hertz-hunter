## Introduction

A poor-man's [RF Explorer](https://j3.rf-explorer.com/) for FPV drones. Useful for quickly determining which frequencies are in use, where background noise is occurring, and diagnosing malfunctioning video transmitters (VTXs). Designed to be cheap (<$60 AUD) and easy to build yourself.

At a racing event I attended there was an issue with someone's damaged VTX broadcasting at full power on two channels, thus interfering with another pilot. A spectrum analyser was essential for diagnosing this issue, as two peaks at different frequencies could be seen in the spectrum graph when only the damaged VTX was powered on.

This project aims to make this useful tool more accessible to pilots and race organisers, and can be easily added to a race-day tool bag. It uses a common RX5808 video receiver to scan from 5645MHz to 5945MHz and displays a graph of the received signal strength (RSSI) on different frequencies within this range on a small OLED display.

### Wiring

## Software

### Environment setup

**1. Install the Arduino IDE**

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) and install it.

**2. Update `Additional boards manager URLs`**

The ESP32 board used in this project isn't supported out-of-the-box by the Arduino IDE, so it needs to be added manually.

In the Arduino IDE, open `File > Preferences`, and in the `Additional boards manager URLs` field, paste the following, then click `OK`:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
```

This will update the list that the Arduino IDE checks to know where to install additional boards from, but doesn't actually install the board. 

**3. Install ESP32 support**

Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager` and search for `ESP32`. Install the one by `Espressif Systems`.

</div>

### Firmware setup

**1. Download firmware**

On GitHub, under `Releases`, click the most recent version.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Releases.png" alt="Releases" />
</div>

Under `Assets`, click the `Source code (zip)` link to download the firmware.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Assets.png" alt="Assets" />
</div>

**2. Open firmware in Arduino IDE**

Unzip the downloaded file. You should see the project files within. Open the folder named `main`, which contains all the source code files for the firmware.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Files.png" alt="Files" />
</div>

Double click `main.ino`, which should open in the Arduino IDE, along with the rest of the files shown above.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/IDE.png" alt="IDE" width="80%" />
</div>

**3. (If necessary) Change display chip being used**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This step is only necessary if using an OLED with the SSD1306 chip. OLEDs that use the SH1106 chip require no modification to the firmware.

As far as I can tell, most 0.96" I<sup>2</sup>C OLEDs use the SSD1306 chip, but I think a bigger 1.3" OLED is better for this project, which mostly seem to use the SH1106 controller. As such, the SH1106 controller is what this device has been developed for, but with some slight modifications it should be possible to use SSD1306 displays.

> [!NOTE]
>
> I haven't personally tested this. All the 1.3" OLEDs I've used have SH1106 chips.

Open `menu.h` and find the following line:

```c++
extern U8G2_SH1106_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C u8g2;
```

Below this line there should be:

```cpp
// extern U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C u8g2;
```

Add `//` to the front of the first line, and remove it from the front of the second line.

Open `menu.cpp` and find the following line:

```cpp
U8G2_SH1106_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C u8g2(U8G2_R0, U8X8_PIN_NONE);
```

Below this line there should be:

```cpp
// U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C u8g2(U8G2_R0, U8X8_PIN_NONE);
```

Add `//` to the front of the first line, and remove it from the front of the second line.

### Flashing

**1. Connect ESP32**

Plug the ESP32 module into the computer with a USB-C cable.

**2. Select board**

Go to `Tools > Board > esp32` and select `ESP32C3 Dev Module`. 

**3. Select port**

Go to `Tools > Port` and select the port the ESP32 is plugged into.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Port selection.png" alt="Port selection" />
</div>

**4. Compile and upload firmware**

Click the `Upload` button to compile the firmware and upload it to the ESP32.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Upload.png" alt="Upload" />
</div>

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're getting errors during flashing, or the device doesn't appear, go to `Tools > USB CDC On Boot` and change it to `Enabled`. This allows the USB connection to remain active during boot, which can help with problems where the port isn't detected after the ESP32 reboots.

### Battery calibration

Different boards, even of the same model, can have variations in their Analog-to-Digital converters, so performing a simple calibration is necessary to ensure the device reads the correct battery voltage.

Turn the device on, and in the bottom right corner of the main menu there will be a battery voltage readout, displaying, for example, `4.0v`. Take a multimeter and measure the raw battery voltage, rounded to 1 decimal place. The voltage on the multimeter and the voltage displayed on the main menu should ideally be the same, but it may be off by a small amount.

The value of `BATTERY_VOLTAGE_OFFSET` in `battery.h` can be increased or decreased, where a change of `1` in this value corresponds to a change of `0.1` in the displayed voltage.

For example, if the main menu is displaying `3.9v`, but the multimeter says the battery is at `4.0v`, then increase the value of `BATTERY_VOLTAGE_OFFSET` by `1`. If the menu displays a voltage higher than what the multimeter reads, then decrease the offset value.

Make the necessary changes, then compile and upload the firmware again.

## Usage

### Menus

There are three buttons used to operate the device:

- `PREV` - Go to the previous item
- `SEL` - Select an item
    - Press and hold `SEL` to go back
- `NEXT` - Go to the next item

The menu items can be navigated between with `PREV` and `NEXT`, and once the desired menu item is highlighted, `SEL` can be used to select it.

**Main**

This is the initial menu displayed when the device is powered on. It displays the options to navigate to the `Scan` menu, `Settings` submenus, `About` menu, and a hidden `Calibration` submenu. The current battery voltage is also displayed in the bottom right.

The hidden `Calibration` submenu can be accessed by pressing and holding `SEL`.

**Scan**

This menu is where the graph of the scanned RSSI values is displayed, and is covered more in [Scanning](#scanning).

**Scan interval**

Set the interval at which the spectrum will be scanned. A lower scan interval means that more frequencies are scanned, at the cost of taking longer to complete a full refresh, as each frequency takes about 30ms to scan. A higher scan interval means that fewer frequencies are scanned, but a full refresh is significantly faster.

Across the 300MHz spectrum being scanned (5645MHz to 5945Hz):

- `5MHz` scans 61 frequencies every 5MHz
    - $(300/5)+1$ to also include the final frequency
- `10MHz` scans 31 frequencies every 10MHz
    - $(300/10)+1$ to also include the final frequency
- `20MHz` scans 16 frequencies every 20MHz
    - $(300/20)+1$ to also include the final frequency

The currently set option is displayed with the <img src="./icons/Selected.png" alt="Selected" /> icon.

**Buzzer**

Enable or disable the single beep that sounds on pressing a button, and the double beep that sounds on going back. This option doesn't affect the double beep on boot, nor the low battery alarm. These will always sound.

The currently set option is displayed with the <img src="./icons/Selected.png" alt="Selected" /> icon.

**Battery alarm**

Set the voltage that the low battery alarm will go off at.

The currently set option is displayed with the <img src="./icons/Selected.png" alt="Selected" /> icon.

**About**

Displays information about the device, such as the current firmware version and the creator's name.

**Calibration**

Where calibration of known high and low RSSI values takes place. Helper text is displayed at the bottom to remind you which channel to set your VTX to when calibrating. This menu is covered more in [RSSI calibration](#rssi-calibration).

### RSSI calibration



### Resetting

Due to the fact that the settings and calibration values are stored in non-volatile memory, flashing the firmware again won't wipe them. If, for some reason, the device needs to be completely reset, press `PREV`, `SEL` and `NEXT` simultaneously. The device should reboot with everything completely reset.
