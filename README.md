# Hertz Hunter

A poor-man's [RF Explorer](https://j3.rf-explorer.com/) for FPV drones. Useful for quickly determining which frequencies are in use, where background noise is occurring, and diagnosing malfunctioning video transmitters (VTXs). Designed to be cheap (<$60 AUD) and easy to build yourself.

At a racing event I attended there was an issue with someone's damaged VTX broadcasting at full power on two channels, thus interfering with another pilot. A spectrum analyser was essential for diagnosing this issue, as two peaks at different frequencies could be seen in the spectrum graph when only the damaged VTX was powered on.

This project aims to make this useful tool more accessible to pilots and race organisers, and can be easily added to a race-day tool bag. It uses a common RX5808 video receiver to scan from 5645MHz to 5945MHz and displays a graph of the received signal strength (RSSI) on different frequencies within this range on a small OLED display.

## Features

- Scanning of the RF spectrum commonly used by FPV racing drones (5645MHz to 5945MHz)
- Graphing RSSI to show which frequencies VTXs are broadcasting on
- Three buttons (`PREV`, `SEL`, `NEXT`) for navigating menus and controlling the device
- Selectable scanning interval
    - A 5MHz interval offers the highest resolution at the slowest update rate
    - A 10MHz interval offers a medium resolution at a medium update rate
    - A 20MHz interval offers the lowest resolution at the fastest update rate
- Battery voltage monitoring with low battery alarm
- Calibration between known low and high RSSI values
- Displaying calibrated signal strength for the selected frequency

### Potential future features

> [!NOTE]
>
> No commitment is made to implementing these. They're things I think would be cool to do, but may never actually see the light of day.

- Custom PCB with integrated power management circuitry
- 3D printed case for a custom PCB
- API accessible from a Wi-Fi hotspot for integration with other software
- Web interface to interact with the scanner and display more detailed graphs

### Wiring

## Software

### Environment setup

**1. Install the Arduino IDE**

Download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/) and install it.

**2. Update `Additional boards manager URLs`**

The ESP32 board used in this project isn't supported out of the box by the Arduino IDE, so it needs to be added manually.

Open `File > Preferences`, and in the `Additional boards manager URLs` field, paste the following, then click `OK`:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
```

This has updated the list that Arduino IDE checks to know where to install additional boards from, but doesn't actually install the board. 

**3. Install ESP32 support**

Go to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager` and search for `ESP32`. Install the one by `Espressif Systems`.

</div>

### Firmware setup

**1. Download firmware**

On GitHub, under `Releases`, click the most recent version.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Releases.png" alt="Releases" />
</div>

Under `Assets`, click the `Source code (zip)` link to download the firmware.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Assets.png" alt="Assets" />
</div>

**2. Open firmware in Arduino IDE**

Unzip the downloaded file. You should see the project files within. Open the folder named `main`, which contains all the source code files for the firmware.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Files.png" alt="Files" />
</div>

Double click `main.ino`, which should open in the Arduino IDE, along with the rest of the files shown above.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/IDE.png" alt="IDE" width="80%" />
</div>

**3. (If necessary) Change display chip being used**



### Flashing

**1. Connect ESP32**

Plug the ESP32 module into the computer with a USB-C cable.

**2. Select board**

Go to `Tools > Board > esp32` and select `ESP32C3 Dev Module`. 

**3. Select port**

Go to `Tools > Port` and select the port the ESP32 is plugged into.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Port selection.png" alt="Port selection" />
</div>

**4. Compile and upload firmware**

Click the `Upload` button to compile the firmware and upload it to the ESP32.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/Upload.png" alt="Upload" />
</div>

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're getting errors during flashing, or the device doesn't appear, go to `Tools > USB CDC On Boot` and change it to `Enabled`. This allows the USB connection to remain active during boot, which can help problems where the port isn't detected after the ESP32 reboots.

### Battery calibration

Different boards, even of the same model, can have variations in their Analog-to-Digital converters, so performing a simple calibration is necessary to ensure the device reads the correct battery voltage.

Turn the device on, and in the bottom right corner of the main menu there should be a battery voltage readout, displaying, for example, `4.0v`. Take a multimeter and measure the raw battery voltage, rounded to 1 decimal place. The voltage on the multimeter and the voltage displayed on the main menu should ideally be the same, but it may be off by a small amount.

The value of `BATTERY_VOLTAGE_OFFSET` in `battery.h` can be increased or decreased, where a change of `1` in this value corresponds to a change of `0.1` in the displayed voltage.

For example, if the main menu is displaying `3.9v`, but the multimeter says the battery is at `4.0v`, then increase the value of `BATTERY_VOLTAGE_OFFSET` by `1`. If the menu displays a voltage higher than what the multimeter reads, then decrease the offset value.

Make the necessary changes, then compile and upload the firmware again.

## Usage

### Menus



### Scanning



### Calibration



### Resetting

Due to the fact that the settings and calibration values are stored in non-volatile memory, flashing the firmware again won't wipe them. If, for some reason, the device needs to be completely reset, press `PREV`, `SEL` and `NEXT` simultaneously. The device should reboot with everything completely reset.
